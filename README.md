# CS3016 Labs

This repo contains the Haskell Labs/Exercises for CS3016 in academic year 2016-17.

## Installing Stack

`stack` is installed on ICTLAB machines,
and the Schools Unix machines for students.

To install on your own machine go to
https://docs.haskellstack.org/en/stable/README/
and follow instructions carefully.

## Generic Lab Instructions

We assume you start in the directory called CS3016-1617

### Command-Line setup

Start up a command-line application

e.g. `Terminal` on OS X, or `cmd` on Windows.

### Important: for School-supplied Windows machines in ICTLAB I or II

Run the batchfile `ICTLAB-SETUP.bat` here first.

Do **not** do this on your own personal Windows machine!

### Access relevant sub-directory

For LabNN go into the sub-folder of the same name.

### Testing your code

From the command line, issue the following command

```
> stack test
```

You might have to wait a while, 
particularly if this is the first time you do this.

Your task is to get all the tests to succeed.

### Submitting your work

Move back up the top CS3016-1617 directory.

Archive (ZIP/tar/compress) the relevant LabNN directory.

Upload the corresponding archive to Blackboard.
