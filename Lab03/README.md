# CS3016 Lab 03 Binary Search Tree
## Task

You have to complete 4 tasks

1. Implement the `treeShow` function (8 marks)
2. Implement the `treeMap` function (3 marks)
3. Implement the `treeInsert` function (5 marks)
4. Implemented the `treeLookup` function (4 marks)


Details of these are in the file Lab03.hs
in the src directory.

Again, as for the previous labs, Lab03.hs is the ***only*** file you should modify.

## Running Tests

As with previous labs, you need to type
`stack test`
to run the tests.

## Submitting Work

Remember to zip/tar or otherwise archive/compress the Lab03 *folder*
and submit this to Blackboard.
Currently supported archive formats are `.zip`, `.tar`, `.tar.gz`

*Do not use `.rar` !*

You should upload somethng of the form
`Lab03.zip`, `Lab03.tar`, or  `Lab03.tar.gz`.

## Running the Interpeter

You can also type

`stack ghci` 

to startup the GHCi interpeter.
Type `:help` to get help.

Once the interpeter is loaded,
enter the command

`:l Lab03`

which will load up the Lab02.hs file so you can experiment.

Simply type an expression at the prompt and GHCi will evaluate it.

The command 

`:browse`

will show all the values currently defined in that file.

You can exit the interpeter by typing

`:q`
