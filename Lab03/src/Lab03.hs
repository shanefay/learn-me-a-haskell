{-   ====== Task 1 ========

  treeShow takes two inputs:

    inDeep - a boolean indicating if the second argument occurs inside a BinTree
    bintree - a BinTree

  It returns a result of type String
    This converts the BinTree to a string.
    This should be the same as produced by show,
    if the BinTree datatype was declared with "deriving Show"

{- ====== Task 2 ===== 

 treeMap takes three inputs:

 a function to transform key values
 a function to transform datum values
 a BinTree

 It returns a new BinTree with keys and datum values transformed
 using the first two function-valued inputs

{- ===== Task 3 =====

Implement an insertion function.

1. It should never produce a BinTree component  of the form 
     Branch Empty key datum Empty
2. If inserting into a Leaf requires a Branch as a result
   then the original Leaf key and datum end up in a sub-tree

{-   ===== Task 4 ======

Implement a lookup function

treeLookup _ Empty = Nothing
treeLookup key (Leaf k d)
  | key == k = Just d
  | otherwise = Nothing
treeLookup key (Branch (left) k d (right))

  | otherwise = treeLookup key right
