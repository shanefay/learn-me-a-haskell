# CS3016 Lab 02  Finding Fastest Segment

## Task

You have to complete 4 tasks

1. Implement `pathDistance` (3 marks)
2. Implement `pathTime` (3 marks)
3. Implement `getMeasured` (5 marks)
4. Implement `findFastest` (9 marks)


Details of these are in the file Lab02.hs
in the src directory.

Again, as for the previous labs, Lab02.hs is the ***only*** file you should modify.

## Running Tests

As with previous labs, you need to type
`stack test`
to run the tests.

## Submitting Work

Remember to zip/tar or otherwise archive/compress the Lab02 folder
and submit this to Blackboard.
Currently supported archive formats are `.zip`, `.tar`, `.tar.gz`

*Do not use `.rar` !*

You should upload somethng of the form
`Lab02.zip`, `Lab02.tar`, or  `Lab02.tar.gz`.

## Running the Interpeter

You can also type

`stack ghci` 

to startup the GHCi interpeter.
Type `:help` to get help.

Once the interpeter is loaded,
enter the command

`:l Lab02`

which will load up the Lab02.hs file so you can experiment.

Simply type an expression at the prompt and GHCi will evaluate it.

The command 

`:browse`

will show all the values currently defined in that file.

You can exit the interpeter by typing

`:q`
