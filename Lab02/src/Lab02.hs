  If the distance of p is less than rqdDist
  it returns all of p

{- ============ Task 4 =============
  Function findFastest has two arguments

  rqdDist :: Distance
  p ::SegPath

  It looks for a sub-path of p of
  length rqdDist 
  (or slightly above, as returned by getMeasured)
  that has the fastest speed, as given by pathSpeed.

  It returns Nothing if the initial path p is too short,
  otherwise it returns Just (pf,sf)
  where pf is the fastest SeqPath, and sf is its speed.

  When two sub-paths have the same speed (unlikely)
  it returns the one that occurs first.
