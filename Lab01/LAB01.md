# CS3016 Lab 01  Computing Path Distances

## Task

You have to complete 3 tasks

1. Implement the `sqr` function (4 marks)
2. Implement the `distance` function (6 marks)
3. Implement the `pathlength` function (10 marks)

The `sqrt` function from the Prelude might be useful.

Details of these are in the file Lab01.hs
in the src directory.

Again, as for the previous lab, Lab01.hs is the ***only*** file you should modify.

## Running Tests

As with Lab00, you need to type

`stack test`

to run the tests.

## Submitting Work

Remember to zip/tar or otherwise archive/compress the Lab01 folder
and submit the ***whole*** thing to Blackboard.

Currently supported archive formats are `.zip`, `.tar`, `.tar.gz`

## Running the Interpeter

You can also type

`stack ghci` 

to startup the GHCi interpeter.

Once the interpeter is loaded,
enter the command

`:l Lab01`

which will load up the Lab01.hs file so you can experiment.

Simply type an expression at the prompt and GHCi will evaluate it.

The command 

`:browse`

will show all the values currently defined in that file.

You can exit the interpeter by typing

`:q`
